# mercado-libre-test
 
Basic app that allows an user to search for products in Mercado Libre Colombia
and see some details of the product.

The app was implemented using SwiftUI framework.

Reusable and centralized desing structs,fuctions and views were implemented for basic customizations.

A MVVM architecture was used.

A singleton network provider was implemed.

Protocolo oriented programming was used to connect the view models to the network provider.

Unit test implemented for the view models.

View models contain state variables that define view state.

Only the two EP provided that did not require access code were used.

The design was kept very simple due to time contraints.
